Genomic data can be stored in different formats. [PLINK](http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/) and [VCF](https://www.internationalgenome.org/wiki/Analysis/vcf4.0/) files are commonly used in genetic epidemiology studies. We have a GWAS example available at [BRGE data repository](https://github.com/isglobal-brge/brgedata) that aims to find SNPs associated with asthma. We have data stored in VCF (brge.vcf) with several covariates and phenotypes available in the file brge.txt (gender, age, obesity, smoking, country and asthma status). The same data is also available in PLINK format (brge.bed, brge.bim, brge.fam) with covariates in the file brge.phe.
